3. master observes clients
4. master closes room, notify clients of world

```js

// mid-level api - recognition

// potentially call several times to observe different angles + new markers
jumbotron.observe(imagedata)

// calculate the world dimensions, and positions of each marker
jumbotron.construct();
// -> {width: 2000, height: 3000, markers: [{id: 32, transform: [â€¦]}]}

// get going
jumbotron.start();
